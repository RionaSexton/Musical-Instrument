# Musical Instrument Assignment
Name: Riona Sexton
Student Number: C23729209

# Description
The project consists of a series of buttons programmed to play different notes on a scale. Each buttons' placement corresponds with the keys on the xylophone shown on screen and can be played in any order at any time. It plays 8 different notes from C7-C6.

# How to use
Click on any of the different keys on screen to play the note that belongs to it. The notes can be clicked and played in a certain order to create a song. For most efficient outcome, a touch screen device can be used to play more notes at a faster pace.

# How it works
I was able to create a function where once the player presses a button on screen it would play a certain audio track. By using $AudioStreamPlayer.play() I was able to get the sound to play aswell as allow multiple notes to play over eachother so as to avoid hindering or slowing down the person playing the music. I was also able to bind the buttons to the keys shown on the png to create a more natural and instinctive feel to new users.

# What I am most proud of
I am most proud of the clean and clear layout of the instrument and how intuitive it is to know how to play it. I am also quite proud of the audio quality of the notes themselves as I recorded those myself.

The audio files were my own recordings using a friends' xylophone and Audacity to record and refine the notes.
